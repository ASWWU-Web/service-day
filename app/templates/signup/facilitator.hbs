<h2>Facilitator Signup</h2>
<p>As a facilitator you are responsible for facilitating Service Day at your school.
  This includes, but is not limited to, providing rides to other students,
  contacting students that have not shown up, and providing any additional help that will make this service day run smoothly.
  This will also make your account's email visible to other students.
